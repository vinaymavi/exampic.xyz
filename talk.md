# Sandbox talk 

* How we can use service-worker with WASM?
* How we can use web worker with WASM?
* What is WASM architecture?
* How it is banificial?
* How to compile and run hello world?
* What is best case scenarios for CAR application?
* What could be the best scenarios for other industries?
* Include Stories from other industries like Autocad, Figma, Photoshop, wordpress,
* Virtual machine concept
* How people using it for build cross platfrom applications.
* How game engines using it for cross platform applications.
* Construct2 game engine example
* FFmpeg example
* box2d example
* zlib example
* Pnc crush example
* WebGL
* Web Audio
* Web RTC
* Web is sharable with the help of link
* Web history how HTML got created
* Use threds for heavy computation
* Performance comparison with JS and WASM
* Why WASM is more consistent than JS
* How this WASM help to build technology gap?
* How this help to non profit organization or open source project to deliver their product to the market?
* How V8 engine load WASM?
* How WASM is more secure than JS?
* How V8 load JS?
* What is JIT compiler? does is work with WASM? or V8 use JIT compiler for WASM?
* What is asm.js and how it is related to WASM?
* What is turbofan and liftoff in V8 engine?
* Why we need JS file to load WASM or compile WASM?(JS is glue code for WASM)

## Entry points of JS and WASM

* JS Ignition(Interpreter) and Turbofan
* WASM Liftof(Compiler) and Turbofan

WASM is more predictable than JS as JS optmistion depends on the runtime(Browser JS engine) and WASM depends on the compiler.


* Assembly script - https://www.assemblyscript.org/


* WASM is not a replacement of JS, it is a compliment of JS.

* WASM threding example 

* SIMD - Single instruction multiple data - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SIMD
* SIMD for web assembly - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/SIMD_in_JavaScript
* WASM for AI - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP8Xjzgdpvg

* JS glue code for WASM - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/C_to_wasm

* What is WebIdl - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly

* Web Assembly proposals  github page - 

* Web Assembly debugging 
* This is secure
* What is Web Assembly 
* What are the steps we follow to complie and run WASM
* Major steps to call a WASM function from JS and update the DOM


## Slide ideas 

* We should decide session journey 

* We should decide what we want to cover in the session

* Crate repo based session to provide all information at single place
